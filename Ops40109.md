1) Name the three main components which make up PKI.
  - Certificate Authority (CA): Issues and manages digital certificates.
  - Digital Certificates: Contain the public key and identity information, certified by the CA.
  - Private and Public Keys: Cryptographic keys where the private key is secret and the public key is openly shared.
2) How would you explain, to a non-technical friend, the role PKI plays in protecting traffic between your browser and a web server.
  - PKI ensures that the information sent between your browser and a website is encrypted and secure, much like a sealed envelope that only the recipient can open and verify it's from you.
3) What is the main weakness of the PKI architecture?
  - The main weakness of PKI is the reliance on Certificate Authorities; if a CA is compromised, it can issue fraudulent certificates that undermine security.
