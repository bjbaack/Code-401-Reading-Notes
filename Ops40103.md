### 


1) Consider a bank ATM that allows users to access bank account balances. What measures can the ATM incorporate to cover the principles of the CIA triad?
  - Confidentiality: Encrypt data transmissions and use secure user authentication (like PINs or biometrics).
  - Integrity: Implement checks to verify transaction accuracy and maintain secure logs.
  - Availability: Ensure ATMs have failovers and perform regular maintenance.
2) Name three best practices that support the CIA triad.
  - Continuous Monitoring: Keep an eye on systems to detect and respond to security threats quickly.
  - Strong Access Controls: Limit access to data based on user roles and require multi-factor authentication.
  - Regular Updates and Patches: Keep systems updated to protect against vulnerabilities.
3) What are the three stages of the risk management lifecycle? What is each stageâ€™s main goal or objective?
  - Risk Assessment: Identify and analyze potential risks to prioritize them.
  - Risk Mitigation: Develop and implement strategies to manage or reduce risks.
  - Risk Monitoring and Review: Continuously monitor risks and the effectiveness of mitigation efforts, and make adjustments as needed.
