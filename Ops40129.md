### 


1) Explain threat modeling using real-world non-technical examples.
  - Home Security: Identify threats (burglars, fires), protect valuables and family, figure out risks (break-ins, fire damage), and set defenses (locks, alarms, fire extinguishers).
  - Event Planning: Identify risks (bad weather, low attendance), protect the event setup and schedule, determine impacts (rain, low turnout), and plan mitigations (tents, marketing, backup equipment).
2) What are the four questions that can help us organize threat modeling?
  - What are we working on?
  - What can go wrong?
  - What are we going to do about it?
  - Did we do a good job?
3) You are the project lead for a new application. How would you explain the benefits of Threat Modeling to the rest of the team?
  - Proactive Security: Spot threats early.
  - Resource Optimization: Focus on critical areas.
  - Improved Communication: Everyone understands risks.
  - Enhanced Security: Build a stronger application.
  - Compliance: Meet standards and regulations.
