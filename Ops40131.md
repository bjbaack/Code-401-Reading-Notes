1) What is the main goal of Threat Hunting and how is it different from traditional threat monitoring?
  - Main Goal: Proactively search for threats that have evaded traditional security measures.
  - Difference from Traditional Monitoring: Instead of passively waiting for alerts, threat hunting involves actively seeking out potential threats, analyzing anomalies, and uncovering hidden malware.
2) What are the four types of YARA rules and what does each one of them use to identify and classify malicious software?
  - Meta: Contains metadata about the rule (e.g., author, description).
  - Strings: Defines patterns, such as text, hexadecimal values, or regex, that the rule will look for.
  - Conditions: Logic conditions to determine if the strings match a file or process.
  - Tags: Classify and group rules for better organization and management.
3) How are YARA rules similar to how Anti-Virus programs detect malicious software?
  - Pattern Matching: Both use defined patterns to detect known threats.
  - Signature-Based Detection: Like antivirus signatures, YARA rules look for specific indicators of compromise within files or processes.
  - Rule-Based Logic: Both utilize logical conditions to determine if a file or behavior is malicious.
