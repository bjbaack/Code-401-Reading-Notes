1) How would a security team benefit from implementing a SOAR solution?
  - A SOAR solution helps security teams by automating routine tasks and responses. This lets them focus on more complex issues and improves their reaction times to threats.
2) Explain how a SOAR solution fits into the Incident Response process.
  - In the incident response process, a SOAR solution coordinates and automates tasks using different security tools. This makes reactions to security incidents faster and decision-making quicker.
