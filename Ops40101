1)  How would you convince your future company to pursue SOC2 compliance?
  - Emphasize that SOC2 compliance boosts client trust and opens doors to more business opportunities due to enhanced data security.
2) What are the five SOC2 Trust Principles?
  - Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy.
3)  How would your explain the three levels of the SOC2 pyramid in an analogy your friends or former colleagues would understand?
  - Think of it as building a house: "Security" forms the foundation, "Availability" is the essential utilities like plumbing and electricity, and "Confidentiality, Privacy, and Processing Integrity" are the protective walls and roof.
