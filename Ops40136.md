### 


1) Explain how a cross-site scripting attack works in non-technical terms.
  - An XSS attack happens when a hacker tricks a website into displaying malicious code. This code can steal information, like your login details, by running in your browser without you knowing.
2) What are the three types of XSS attacks?
  - Stored XSS: Malicious code is permanently stored on the target server (e.g., in a database) and displayed to users.
  - Reflected XSS: Malicious code is reflected off a web server, usually in an error message or search result.
  - DOM-based XSS: Malicious code is executed directly in the browser via client-side scripts, without a server response.
3) If an attacker successfully exploits a XSS vulnerability, what malicious actions would they be able to perform?
  - Steal cookies and session tokens
  - Capture user inputs (like passwords)
  - Deface websites
  - Redirect users to malicious sites
4) What are some security controls that can be implemented to prevent XSS attacks?
  - Input Validation: Ensure data entering the system is clean and expected.
  - Output Encoding: Convert special characters to safe versions before displaying them.
  - Content Security Policy (CSP): Restrict resources the browser can load.
  - Web Application Firewall (WAF): Monitor and block malicious requests.
