### 


1) Name the six credential-gathering techniques which Mimikatz is able to perform and explain how two of them work.
  - Pass-the-Hash
  - Pass-the-Ticket
  - Over-Pass-the-Hash
  - Over-Pass-the-Ticket
  - Kerberos Ticket Extraction
  - Credential Dumping

  - Explanation of Two Techniques:
  - Pass-the-Hash: Uses a stolen NTLM hash to authenticate without needing the actual password.
  - Credential Dumping: Extracts plaintext passwords, hashes, and Kerberos tickets from memory.



2) What are four ways we can defend against Mimikatz attacks. Explain how two of the mitigations can stop Mimikatz.
  - Enable Credential Guard
  - Use LSA Protection
  - Enforce Strong Password Policies
  - Monitor and Limit Admin Rights

  - Explanation of Two Mitigations:
  - Credential Guard: Isolates secrets, making it harder for Mimikatz to access credentials.
  - LSA Protection: Secures the Local Security Authority process, preventing unauthorized memory access.
