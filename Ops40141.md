1) How are the stages of a pen test very similar to those of the Cyber Kill Chain?
  - The stages of a penetration test closely mirror the Cyber Kill Chain as both involve reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control, and actions on objectives, each designed to identify, exploit, and mitigate vulnerabilities in a system.
2) Your manager has asked you to explain the benefits of a pentest to the companyâ€™s leadership. How would you lead this conversation?
  - Performing a penetration test helps identify and fix security vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them, reducing the risk of data breaches. It ensures regulatory compliance, enhances our overall security posture, protects our brand reputation, and is cost-effective by preventing more expensive breaches. Additionally, pen tests provide actionable insights that guide security improvements, offering a realistic assessment of our defenses and improving our ability to respond to real-world attack scenarios.
