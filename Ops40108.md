1) How would you convince your organization about the importance of implementing a DLP solution?
  - I would emphasize that DLP is crucial not only for compliance but for protecting our assets from breaches that can lead to significant financial and reputational damage. It ensures our sensitive data is secure from unauthorized access.
2) How would you explain the three main use cases for DLP to friends or family?
  - Personal Information Protection: Like a personal assistant who guards your private details.
  - Intellectual Property Protection: A lock on your secret recipes, accessible only to those allowed.
  - Data Visibility: A dashboard that tracks where and how your data is being used.
