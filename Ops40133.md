1) How are Threat Hunting and Pentesting different?
  - Penetration Testing (Pentesting):
    Simulates attacks to find and exploit vulnerabilities periodically.
  - Threat Hunting:
    Actively searches for hidden threats within the network continuously.
2) What is the primary objective of Threat Hunting?
  - The main goal of threat hunting is to find and stop hidden threats in your network that standard defenses miss. It's about catching attackers early before they cause damage.
3) Your organization has a fully functioning SOC but not active Threat Hunting. How would you advocate for your security organization to start Threat Hunting activities?
  - We need threat hunting to catch advanced threats early, improve our security measures, and respond faster to incidents.
