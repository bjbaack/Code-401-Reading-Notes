Ethics in the Workplace
Article: Amazon workers demand Jeff Bezos cancel "Rekognition" software

Amazon employees are pushing back against "Rekognition," their company's facial recognition software, because of serious ethical concerns. They believe this tech could lead to more surveillance and privacy invasions, especially against marginalized groups. This situation underscores the ethical duty tech companies have to consider the broader impact of their products. I'm with the employees on this one; rolling out such powerful tools without proper safeguards is risky. What stands out here is the employees taking a stand, showing that workers can push their companies to act more responsibly.

Ethics in Technology
Article: Will democracy survive big data and artificial intelligence?

This article dives into how big data and AI can affect democracy, raising red flags about privacy, surveillance, and public opinion manipulation. The massive amounts of data collected can be used to sway political outcomes, threatening democratic processes. I agree that this is a big ethical issue; misuse of big data and AI could seriously undermine democracy. What hit me hardest is the potential for these technologies to be used for political control, not just commercial purposes, which highlights the need for strong ethical guidelines and regulations in tech.
