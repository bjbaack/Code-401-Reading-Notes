1) Explain how Burp Suite allows us to analyze web application traffic.
  - Burp Suite intercepts and analyzes web traffic between your browser and the server. It captures HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses, letting you see and modify them to test how the web app reacts to different inputs
2) What does the Repeater tool allow us to do with requests?
  - The Repeater tool allows you to modify and resend HTTP requests manually. It’s great for tweaking payloads to see how the server responds to various changes
3) Why might this be a useful tool for an attacker?
  - Attackers use Repeater to refine their payloads and test different inputs. It helps them find ways to exploit vulnerabilities by seeing immediate responses from the server​
