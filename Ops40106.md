1) You have been made responsible for the company’s file server. How would you preserve the three elements of the CIA triad?
  - Confidentiality: Encrypt data whether it's stored or being sent, and beef up access control with stuff like two-factor authentication.
  - Integrity: Use hash functions and digital signatures to check that data hasn’t been messed with.
  - Availability: Use backup systems and regular backups to make sure data is always there when you need it.
2) Explain how hashing verifies data integrity using non-technical terms.
  - Think of hashing as making a unique fingerprint for your data. If anything changes, the fingerprint won't match, showing that the data's been altered.
3) How is hashing and encryption different?
  - Hashing: Creates a unique, irreversible signature (hash) of the data.
  - Encryption: Scrambles data into a code that can be reversed only with the right key, keeping the information private.
