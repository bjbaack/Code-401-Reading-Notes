  - A "man-in-the-middle proxy" is like a sneaky middleman in a conversation. Imagine you're talking to a friend, but everything you say goes through someone else who can listen, change, or block the messages before passing them on. In cybersecurity, this means intercepting and possibly altering data between two parties without them knowing.
